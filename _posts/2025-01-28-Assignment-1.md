<h3> Taking this image was particularly hard because A. I realized I carry so many personal items with me, B. I carry a lot of unnecessary items that were too embarrasing to show, and C. I apparently carry a lot of weirdly shaped objects which made it hard to organize them so I kinda cheated and took out the too weirdly shaped objects. </h3>
      
      
<h2>Here are the objects:</h2>

<h2>1. A stack of postcards from Alain: </h2>
<h3>I'm not sure where they came from but I remember finding them in my room and I wanted to distribute them to my friends and random people I bump into and they have been there for the entirety of last semester (I promise I'm trying my best).</h3>

<h2>2. Fjallraven Kanjen Pencilcase:</h2>
<h3>I do not like pencilcases but I carry this one because it reminds me of my sister since she gave it to me a couple of years back so it has some sort of sentimental value to me and It is filled with little trinkets I take when I go out with friends.</h3>
    
<h2>3. Macbook Air: </h2>
<h3>I bought this last month and I only carry it because I always have the thought of "what if I suddenly need it?"</h3>

<h2>4. Black Permanent Sharpie:</h2>
<h3>I am very spontaneous with my arts and crafts projects and you also never know when you're gonna need a sharpie.</h3>

<h2>5. Green Hydroflask:</h2>
<h3>This Hydroflask has seen and been with me through my brightest and darkest days. It is a true soldier as it has been dropped more times than I can count. It also travelled with me to Greece, Germany, and Austria.</h3>

<h2>6. Green Notebook:</h2>
<h3>I only use this notebook when I want to speak to the person next to me in class because I do not like whispering.</h3>

<h2>7. Apple Watch:</h2>
<h3>I truly could not tell you how this watch still works. This watch was my eldest sister's graduation gift from my family 11 years ago, it was then passed down to my brother who abandoned it for a year then I found it on a random tuesday three years ago and I started using it daily. </h3>

<h2>8. Ipad:</h2>
<h3>This Ipad is my child. I will not go anywhere without it as it always entertains me and the people around me whenever and wherever we are.</h3>

<h2>9. Mini Cooper Keys:</h2>
<h3>I do not trust pockets so I always keep my car key in my bag.</h3>

<h2>10. Iphone: <h2>
I like texting people.

11. Scrapbook:
You never know when I would have the sudden urge to start scrapbooking.

12. USB-C adapter:
So my friends have no excuse not to send the digital camera photos.
  
13. A keychain of pink thing driving:
A friend gifted me this because it "Looks like me."
