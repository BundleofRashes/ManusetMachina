    <p>My original concept of a beanie with holes for overhead headphones was not machine-doable because it is a very human process. So, I have four new ideas that are more machine than human made:</p>
    
<h2>1. Mood Patches (Adaptable Expressions)</h2>
    <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Small laser-cut fabric patches with simple face expressions (neutral, happy, anxious, etc.) that people can Velcro onto their bags/clothes to "adapt" their outward emotions.</p>
    <p><strong>Fabrication:</strong> Heat-transfer vinyl or laser-cut felt. (?)</p>
    <p><strong>Software:</strong> Illustrator for vector designs.</p>
    
    
 <h2>2. Augmented Fortune Cards</h2>
    <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Small business card-sized prints with fortunes/advice for surviving modern life ("Don't open Twitter before bed," "Charge your phone before you go out.").</p>
    <p><strong>Fabrication:</strong> Laser-engraved wood or printed cardstock.</p>
    <p><strong>Software:</strong> Illustrator or Canva for simple design.</p>
    
<h2>3. Emergency Compliment Stickers</h2>
    <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Sticker sheets with phrases like "Youâ€™ve survived 100% of your worst days" or "You are built to adapt."</p>
    <p><strong>Fabrication:</strong> Die-cut vinyl stickers (print & cut method).</p>
    <p><strong>Software:</strong> Canva or Illustrator.</p>
    
 <h2>4. Stress avoiding Cards or keychains</h2>
    <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Business-card-sized with "stress avoiding underneath, like "Did you take out the chicken like mom said?" , "Did you turn off the oven?" "Did you forget your dignity in the kitchen again?"</p>
    <p><strong>Fabrication:</strong> Printed cardstock or checklist keychain with replacable papers (?)</p>
    <p><strong>Software:</strong> Canva or Illustrator.</p>
